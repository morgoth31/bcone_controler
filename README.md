# bcone_controller: BLE to MQTT Bridge for Lifebuoy Alarms

`bcone_controller` is a Python script that acts as a bridge between a Lifebuoy Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) alarm device and a Home Assistant installation. It uses the `bleak` library to communicate with the BLE device and `paho-mqtt` to send and receive messages from an MQTT broker. The script automatically discovers and configures entities in Home Assistant using the MQTT discovery protocol.

## Features

-   Connects to a Lifebuoy BLE alarm device.
-   Reads sensor data (battery level, temperature, alarm status, etc.).
-   Allows controlling the device (mode, sensitivity, etc.) via MQTT.
-   Integrates with Home Assistant via MQTT discovery.
-   Configuration via a simple `config.json` file.

## Prerequisites

-   Python 3.7+
-   A Bluetooth adapter on the machine running the script.
-   An MQTT broker (e.g., Mosquitto).
-   Home Assistant with MQTT integration configured.

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/bcone_controller.git
    cd bcone_controller
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment and activate it:**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Configuration

Before running the script, you need to create a `config.json` file in the same directory. You can use the provided `config.example.json` as a template.

1.  **Copy the example configuration:**
    ```bash
    cp config.example.json config.json
    ```

2.  **Edit `config.json` with your settings:**

    ```json
    {
        "bluetooth": {
            "target_address": "B4:3A:31:E4:14:FB",
            "read_interval": 60
        },
        "mqtt": {
            "broker_address": "192.168.1.62",
            "port": 1883,
            "username": "mqttuser",
            "password": "mqttpassword"
        },
        "home_assistant": {
            "device_id": "lifebuoy_alarm_01",
            "device_name": "Alarme Lifebuoy"
        }
    }
    ```

    -   `target_address`: The MAC address of your Lifebuoy BLE device.
    -   `read_interval`: The interval in seconds at which the script reads data from the device.
    -   `broker_address`, `port`, `username`, `password`: Your MQTT broker credentials.
    -   `device_id`, `device_name`: The ID and name for the device in Home Assistant.

## Usage

To run the script, simply execute the following command from the project directory:

```bash
python bcone_controller.py
```

The script will start, connect to the MQTT broker, and then begin searching for the BLE device. Once connected, it will start publishing data to MQTT and listening for commands.

## Home Assistant Integration

The script uses MQTT discovery to automatically create entities in Home Assistant. Once the script is running, you should see a new device in your Home Assistant instance with the following entities:

### Sensors

-   **Battery Voltage:** The current battery voltage of the device.
-   **Temperature:** The temperature measured by the device.
-   **Alarm Status:** The status of the alarm (e.g., "OFF", "Ringing!").
-   **Signal Attenuation:** The signal strength in dB.
-   **Mode Status:** The current mode of the device (e.g., "ON", "OFF", "SWIM").
-   **Sensitivity Status:** The current sensitivity level.
-   **Standby Time Status:** The current standby time setting.
-   **Alarm Length Status:** The current alarm length setting.
-   **DND From Status:** The start time for "Do Not Disturb" mode.
-   **DND To Status:** The end time for "Do Not Disturb" mode.

### Controls

-   **Mode:** A dropdown to select the device mode (`ON`, `OFF`, `SWIM`).
-   **Standby Time:** A slider to set the standby time (1-30 minutes).
-   **Alarm Length:** A slider to set the alarm duration (5-180 seconds).
-   **Sensitivity:** A slider to set the sensitivity (1-5).
-   **DND From:** A slider to set the "Do Not Disturb" start time.
-   **DND To:** A slider to set the "Do Not Disturb" end time.
